Simple Steps to create a Project in GitHub

	3) Then choose a "Create repository"

Create a folder where you want to have the git Repository, and inside the folder create a simple file(text) or put a simple img...

Now that you create a repository and a folder, you open a terminal to do your first commit( inside the folder)
	4)git init
	5)git status        #you see that have an untracked file
	6)git add text	
	7)git status		#the untracked file already disappear

	8)git remote add origin https://github.com/TiagoVilaFlor/GitTest.git		 #only do this step when you create the 					#Repository

	9)git push -u origin master


Create an other Branch
	10)git branch dev
	11)git push -u origin dev

See the present branch
	12) git branch

Select a different branch
	13)git checkout dev

Create and change to another branch inside a dev branch
	14)git branch feature1
	15)git push -u dev feature1
	16)git checkout feature1

	if you want do the step 14 and 16 in one line
		17)git checkout -b feature1 dev
		18)git push -u dev feature1

Merge the changes in feature1-branch with dev-branch
	19)git checkout dev
	20)git merge --no-ff feature1
	21)git push -u origin dev

Restore a deleted file (let's say the file name was text.txt)
	22)git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path>
	   # Find the last commit that affected the given path, i.e.,
	   # affected the deleted file (in this case <file_path> would
	   # be changed by text.txt, if the file was in project root folder.
	   # The above command will print that commit id, that we will need
	   # for the next step, let's say id is 12345.
	23)git checkout 12345^ -- text.txt
	   # Checkout the version at the commit before the deletion of the
	   # file, and now you have recover your file.
